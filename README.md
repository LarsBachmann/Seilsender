# Seilsender
The Seilsender ("rope transmitter") is a mobile measuring and broadcasting station to transmit the spontaneous sounds of the ropes of Alpine ropeways live on the Internet. The ropes act as resonating bodies that react to wind, thermal forces, earth movements, birds and human activities and often show very complex and long-lasting processes.
